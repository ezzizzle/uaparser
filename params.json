The project will never be complete and probably contains many Go faux pas.\r\n\r\n### So why am I even looking at this?\r\nGood question. But if you like something and want to get in touch feel free.\r\n\r\n### And you then built a page for it?\r\nYes I did. I wanted to see how GitHub pages work. Seems like a pretty easy way to get a site up and going without having to do any heavy lifting which is nice.",
